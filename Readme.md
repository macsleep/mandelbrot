# Mandelbrot

## Description

This is an old, classic, simple Mandelbrot Fractal generator using OpenGL and GLUT. I wrote this program to learn how to modify pixels using OpenGL.

## Build

Clone or download the software. Make sure the required OpenGL and GLUT libraries are installed and then type `make` to build. The build is known to work on MacOS (10.12) and Ubuntu (18.04.5).

## Usage

You can use the left mouse button to zoom in on details. The zoom box is also drawn using OpenGL. The right mouse button resets the generator to its default coordinates. And the Escape key exits the application in classic GLUT style.
